//! Per-item event data for the content-addressed storage API.
//!
//! Each put/get/copy/obliterate/query/upload operation terminates an item
//! with an `*_ITEM_COMPLETE` event. `get` additionally emits a `HEADER` and
//! one or more `DATA` events for each item before the terminal. `open`
//! emits a single `OPENED` event on success before `Complete`.
//!
//! All event-data structs here are `#[repr(C)]` PODs carrying the item's
//! correlation `id`, the relevant addresses/partitions, and a
//! [`LoreErrorCode`] discriminator. The companion `LORE_EVENT_ERROR` event
//! (emitted alongside per-item failures) carries the human-readable detail.
