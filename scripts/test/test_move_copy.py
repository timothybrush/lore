Move/Copy Test Suite for Lore.

This is a DIAGNOSTIC test suite - tests are expected to fail initially.
They identify gaps in Lore implementation. DO NOT attempt to fix Lore based on
these failures - they are designed to document expected behavior.

Test categories:
- TestFileMoveCore (REQ-F-1 to REQ-F-7)
- TestFileCopyCore (REQ-F-8 to REQ-F-12)
- TestDirectoryMoveCore (REQ-F-13 to REQ-F-20)
- TestDirectoryCopyCore (REQ-F-21 to REQ-F-26)
- TestFileMerge (REQ-F-27 to REQ-F-34)
- TestDirectoryMerge (REQ-F-35 to REQ-F-41)
- TestFileMoveConflicts (REQ-F-42 to REQ-F-53)
- TestDirectoryMoveConflicts (REQ-F-54 to REQ-F-63)
- TestSyncBranchSwitch (REQ-F-64 to REQ-F-74)

    - Using no_commit=True to keep changes staged

    - Move on one branch, no changes on other branch - verify clean merge
    - Move on one branch, modify same file on other branch - verify merge handles correctly
    - Move on both branches to different locations - verify conflict handling
